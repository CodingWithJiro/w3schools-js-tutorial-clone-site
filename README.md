This is a complete educational website that mirrors the JavaScript tutorials section of [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). It includes structured lessons, live interactive demo buttons, code tables, a responsive layout, theme toggling, and some quirky utilities like tracking the days since I started learning frontend.

## üîç Overview

This project is a full educational clone of the W3Schools JavaScript tutorial section. It features a sidebar with navigation, collapsible content sections, interactive code examples, and visually enhanced demos to mimic real-world documentation.

I created this project from scratch using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to reinforce my understanding of JS topics while also practicing DOM manipulation, styling, layout, and accessibility features. This is my longest and challenging project yet.
